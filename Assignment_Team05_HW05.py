This is question designed by us.
It's not very hard.
!It is about the linear least squares.
We will give a bunch of xdata and ydata.
!The only thing you have to do is to give the equation in the form of "y = ax + b" by using linear least squares method
!AS for the number of data is determined by us, so you can use while loop or for loop with range
Don't use anything such as numpy, scipy or whatever.
I can't test the program without the package.
Don't try to connect to the Wolframalpha or Matlab.
I will test it without internet.
You can surely copy other classmates' codes, but make sure each other's willingness.
Or your codes will be regard as copy one, though you will still get the points.

!xdata and ydata are both lists
!for example, xdata=[1,6,8,4,5,2,3,5], ydata=[4,9,3,5,4,2,6,7]
!we want the result in string "y = 0.2535x + 3.9225"
!for our convenience, please use  if __name__== "__main__":
! MIND IT ! THE PERCISION NEED TO BE AT LEAST E-4(10^-4)
